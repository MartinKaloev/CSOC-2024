Author Statement

The work on this paper and the supporting code was carried out from 2023 until late 2024, during which I served as the author and corresponding author. I conceptualized the experiments, developed the mathematical formulations, wrote the software, conducted the experiments, collected and organized the results, and derived the conclusions. I also prepared and presented the findings in 3D infographics, ensuring the replicability of the experiments by creating appropriate code. Additionally, I managed communication with the journal and drafted the manuscript.

I received payment for my work in 2023 but was not compensated for any contributions made in 2024. My decision to continue working in 2024 was driven solely by my commitment to maintaining ethical integrity, as I believe it is unacceptable to abandon a publication without valid justification.

I retain authorship of this paper and the supporting code.

I would like to emphasize that my work in 2024 was unpaid and should not be used as an example of academic excellence under the assumption of financial compensation. Furthermore, since I received no payment for my 2024 contributions, I will not entertain requests for bureaucratic documentation or tax-related notes regarding unpaid work.
